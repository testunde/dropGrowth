dropGrowth

Simulates (water)drop growing by condesation and accretion effect and the downwards movement through gravitation. This movement is not generated by gravitation, but simply follows a function depending on the drop size.
Start state is a randomly uniform distributed area of very small droplets (around 2E-6 meters in diameter), where as their size is normal distributed. Parameters of this small program can be set in the src/global.h definition. The OpenCV functionality can also be turned off there, which is needed to visualize the simulation environment and create a small video snip. No logs are produced, some state informations are printed to stdout. Starting parameters are not built in yet.

Dependencies: OpenCV v4 (can be disabled in src/global.h; for older versions the source code may be adopted)
